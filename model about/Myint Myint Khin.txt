Biography

Myint Myint Khin was born Khin Kyi to Daw Saw Kyi and U Po Min, in Thanlyin in 1934, during the waning days of the British colonial era in Myanmar.[1] Her father, also known as E.A. Fairmen, was an Englishman from India.[2] Myint Myint Khin's English name is Rita Fairmen.[2] She attended a Yangon convent school up to seventh standard. She made her film debut in 1949 with Maya Shin. Not only was she one of the main leading actresses in the 1950s, Myint Myint Khin went on to win multiple (five) Burmese Academy Awards in her nearly five-decade-long career—a feat still unmatched among Burmese actresses.

In her heyday in the 1950s, Myint Myint Khin also dabbled into a singing career and achieved moderate success. Her most famous hit, Naban Hsan, does remain a Burmese standard, having been covered numerous times by later singers, most famously by her singer daughter May Sweet. 

Personal life

Myint Myint Khin has retired from the movie industry and lives in Yangon. She has five daughters. Her longtime husband Khin Maung Nyunt died in February 2010.
